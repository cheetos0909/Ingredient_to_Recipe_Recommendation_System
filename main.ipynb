Once the capsicum and onion are tender, add the cut paneer pieces, the Del Monte Tandoori Mayo and toss until well coated. Avoid over cooking the paneer at this stage as it can make the paneer rubbery.Spread the aluminium foil on the flat surface and place the tawa paratha over it. Next, place the lettuce evenly over the paratha, add spoon two tablespoons of the paneer filling over one side of the frankie. Roll the paneer frankie tightly till the other end.Fold the ends of the paneer frankie to pack it tightly in the aluminum foil on all sides. This is a great way to carry a frankie to picnics or a party. All you have to do later is to warm it in the oven at 200 C for 5 minutes and then cut it in the center and serve.Serve the Paneer Frankie (Rolls) Recipe along with a glass of\\xa0Indian Spiced
